# healthcare-project
making dashboars and writing optimied recommendations
This project focuses on predicting patient appointment no-shows and improving hospital scheduling efficiency. The appointment dataset was analyzed in Power BI, where data cleaning, DAX-based calculations, and risk scoring were performed to identify high-risk patients. A dashboard was created with KPI cards, bar, donut, and column charts to visualize no-show trends by age, weekday, and SMS reminders. A detailed table also displays patient-wise risk levels and predictions. Based on the insights, recommendations were provided to reduce no-shows through SMS reminders, shorter waiting times, and better scheduling strategies.
